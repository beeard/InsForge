InsForge is an AI-optimized Backend-as-a-Service platform for modern applications. It provides a comprehensive backend out of the box with PostgreSQL, JWT-based authentication, and S3-compatible storage. Every endpoint—from initial configuration to database operations to file uploads—is designed to be agent-friendly with consistent patterns and predictable responses.

## Why Insforge?

Backend development with AI agents has long been a half-solved problem. AI can generate frontend code effortlessly but struggles with backend complexity—database setup, authentication flows, API design all require deep expertise. Rather than forcing developers to piece together multiple services or become DevOps experts, we believe we can do better as a community—hence, InsForge.
